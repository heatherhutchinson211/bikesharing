# Bikesharing
## Overview
The purpose of this project was to use Tableau to create visually appealing analysis for Citibike Data.  The data included information on trip durations, starting and ending times, gender of user, dates of rides, etc.  That data was used to analyze when, where, and who the company should place additional focus on.

## Analysis
For the challenge, the first graph I created was one showing checkout times per user.  It is shown below.

Next, I created a heat map showing trips by weekday, per hour.

I also included two additional graphs showing peak hours of ride time in August, as well as averge trip duration based on birth year, respectively.

Finally, here is the link to my tableau dashboard:

## Summary
After reviewing the data, it seems as if the number of rides increase around 5-7pm.  It is also apparent that trip duration gets slightly longer for younger individuals.  Males seem to participate in more rides than females, across the board.  

In the future I think it would be beneficial to include some additional analysis.  I think the peak ride times during august gave a lot of good information, but I would like to see how that data varies across different months of the year.  I also think it would be beneficial to analyze how average birth years differ upon different starting/ending locations to see which areas are appealing to different age groups.
