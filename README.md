# Bikesharing
## Overview
The prupose of this assignment was to use tableau to create visually appealing analysis for Citibike Data.  The data included information on trip durations, starting and ending times, gender of user, dates of rides, etc.  That data was used to analyze when, where, and who the company should focus on.

## Analysis
For the challenge, the first graph I created was one showin gcheckou times per user.  It is shown below.

The next graph shows similar results, but it is further filtered by gender.  I had some difficulties with my gender data; therefore, each graph filtered by data seems to be a little off.

Next, I created a heat map showing trips by weekday, per hour.

This was then further filtered by gender.

For my final challenge graph, I created a chart showing user trips by gender.

I also included two additional graphs showing peak hours of ride time in August, as well as averge trip duration based on birth year, respectively.

![birthyear]()

## Summary
After reviewing the data, it seems as if the number of rides increase around 5-7pm.  It is also apparent that trip duration gets slightly longer for younger individuals.  Males seem to participate in more rides than females across the board.  

In the future I think it would be beneficial to include some additional analysis.  I think the peak ride times during august gave a lot of good information, but I would like to see how that data varies across different months of the year.  I also think it would be beneficial to analyze how average birth years differ upon different starting/ending locations to see which areas are appealing to different age groups.
